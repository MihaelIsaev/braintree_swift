    /// with an invalid hash in the query string.
    /// The reason why this error happens is because
    /// when the gateway receives the initial Transparent Redirect request,
    /// it generates a query string that includes a verification hash
    /// at the end to protect against tampering in the client.
    /// This hash is calculated based on the entire contents
    /// of the query string minus the hash.
    /// The client library uses the same method to check the hash,
    /// and so you'll get this error any time the query string
    /// passed into the confirm method is not exactly the same
    /// as the query string that the gateway redirected to.
    /// Note: Transparent Redirect is a deprecated integration method.

    /// in transit or if you attempt to parse messages
    /// that did not originate from our servers.

    /// Raised when the record that you're trying to operate
    /// on can't be found. For example, if you try to update
    /// a customer and the customer ID isn't valid.
    /// For references and associations, you'll receive
    /// a validation error if the reference is invalid.
    /// For example, when creating a credit card and
    /// specifying which customer ID it should be associated to,
    /// if the customer ID is invalid, it will be
    /// a validation error, not a not found exception.
